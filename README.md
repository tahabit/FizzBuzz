# FizzBuzz
### Fizzbuzz is a classic coding problem.

In the game Fizz Buzz, players take turns counting up from one. If a player’s turn lands on a number that’s divisible by 3, program should say **“Fizz”** instead of the number, and if it lands on a number that’s divisible by 5, program should say **“Buzz”** instead of the number. If the number is both a multiple of 3 and of 5, program should say **"Fizzbuzz"** instead of the number. A spectator sport, it is not. What it is, however, is an interesting problem in *control flow* and *parameter usage*.
